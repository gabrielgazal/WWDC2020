 # Hey!

 
Welcome to **Sounds like fun!** In this playground we are going to learn a little about what is sound, how we perceive it and many other things related to it in the musical aspect! Hope you like it :)
 
We are constantly listening to different sounds, regardless of wheter they are unpleasant noises, like a car honking, or sweet notes from an instrument making us a song. However, all the sounds are made the same way, through **vibration** wich is sensed by our ears. But how it's done ?
 
The air around us is made of multiple tiny particles and they are the ones carrying the sound from its source to us. When a sound is made from a guitar string, for exemple, that string is vibrating, making the air particles next to it vibrate as well, those particles transfer the vibration to the next ones and so on in what we call a wave.
 
Here's a representation of sound waves and air particles:

 When a sound wave get into our ear, it's vibration is sensed by a part of our ears responsable for taking this vibration deeper until a message is sent to our brain, making possible our perception of the sound.
 
 Tap **Run my code** and test this by yourself! You can use de the slider to change de wave frequency and the button to play/pause the sound.
